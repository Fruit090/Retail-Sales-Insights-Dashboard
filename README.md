### Role: Data Analyst
### Tools: Power BI, Excel

### Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing company sales data to uncover patterns across products, regions, and time. The goal was to build an interactive Power BI dashboard that would help management make data-driven decisions to improve profitability, optimize inventory, and guide regional sales strategies.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

The raw dataset was imported from Excel into Power BI. I ensured data integrity by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. Relationships were created between tables to integrate product, regional, and sales data for seamless reporting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial exploration highlighted overall sales, profit, and quantity sold, while also surfacing the most successful product categories and sub-categories. Regional contributions to total revenue were reviewed, and monthly/yearly sales trends were analyzed to identify seasonality in demand.

### Data Analysis & Visualization

The cleaned data was modeled into a Power BI dashboard featuring KPIs (total sales, profit, and cost), regional performance, category and sub-category analysis, monthly revenue trends, and profitability insights. The dashboard highlighted both top-performing and underperforming areas, providing a clear view of business performance.

### Results & Findings

The analysis revealed 85M in total revenue with 32M in profit. Bikes dominated with 62M, followed by Accessories (15M) and Clothing (8M). At a sub-category level, Road Bikes (33M) and Mountain Bikes (21M) led performance.
Regionally, the United States (28M) was the strongest market, while Australia (21M) and the United Kingdom (11M) followed. Seasonal analysis showed December (9.1M) as the peak month, reflecting strong holiday demand. Profitability peaked in 2015 (7.5M), confirming business growth momentum.

### Recommendations

Based on these insights, I recommended expanding the bike category, leveraging holiday and mid-year demand with targeted promotions, and tailoring strategies to boost sales in moderate markets like Germany, France, and Canada. Inventory planning should align with seasonal peaks, while low-revenue sub-categories could be reviewed for optimization.

### Limitations
The analysis was limited to the provided dataset and timeframe. External factors such as competitor actions, promotions, and customer demographics were not included but could provide additional depth in future studies.
