### Role: Data Analyst
### Tools: Power BI, Excel

### Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze company sales data and build an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover trends across regions, product categories, and time. The goal was to provide management with actionable insights to improve profitability, optimize inventory, and strengthen regional strategies.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

1.Imported raw sales data from Excel into Power BI.

2.Verified data integrity, removed duplicates, and standardized formats.

3.Handled missing values to ensure accurate reporting.

4.Created relationships between tables for seamless reporting in Power BI.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

With the data cleaned and connected, I performed an exploratory analysis to better understand the dataset. I examined total sales, profit, and quantity sold, while also identifying the most and least successful product categories and sub-categories. I reviewed the contributions of various regions to overall sales and assessed time-based trends at both monthly and yearly levels. This provided early insights into seasonality, customer demand, and market dynamics.

### Data Analysis & Visualization

After the EDA, I designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard included a set of KPIs such as total sales, profit, and quantity sold. It provided comparative views of sales across regions, detailed insights into product categories and sub-categories, and a monthly trend analysis that showed peaks and dips in performance. Additionally, the dashboard highlighted the top products contributing to revenue and flagged those with high sales volumes but low profitability, helping to reveal potential inefficiencies.

### Results & Findings

The analysis revealed that total sales reached X over the reporting period, while profits amounted to Y. It became clear that [Region A] outperformed all other regions, while [Region B] lagged behind. Product categories such as Furniture, Technology, and Office Supplies generated the largest share of overall revenue. A time-series review of the data uncovered a strong seasonal pattern, with [Month] recording the highest sales. Importantly, some products demonstrated high revenue but low profit margins, highlighting an opportunity for the business to reassess pricing strategies or renegotiate supplier costs.

### Recommendations

Based on the findings, I recommended focusing investment and marketing efforts on high-margin categories to maximize profitability. Regional sales strategies should be strengthened in underperforming markets to create more balance across regions. I also suggested leveraging seasonal peaks by planning targeted promotional campaigns and optimizing inventory management to align with forecasted demand. Finally, I advised reviewing low-margin, high-sales products to identify ways of improving profitability, whether through cost reductions or price adjustments.

### Limitations

This analysis was limited to the data and timeframe provided in the dataset. While the results are valuable, they did not incorporate customer demographics, marketing spend, or external influences such as competitor activity and promotional campaigns. Including these factors in future analyses would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers of sales performance.
